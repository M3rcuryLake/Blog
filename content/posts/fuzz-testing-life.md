I'm gonna be honest with myself. I’ve been too idle this semester. I’ve achieved nothing, technically speaking. All I’ve done is pretty much rot in my room. Still, I have done some shit apart from academics. The most significant one was learning how to trade. I dived into some pretty easy-to-learn topics: trading patterns, keeping track of market trends.

While the tariff war across the Pacific and the Atlantic worsened, kicking traders left and right on each side of the jaw, I was feeling Mountain Dew, idk. I shorted top-gaining meme coins at the peak, just before the final stop-loss hunt, and let them collapse for a while. This method was insanely risky and unreasonably idiotic, but I’m pretty sure I was betting on market correction, which is kind of expected after a 70% pump. I entered at the second or third tap of the upper resistance level, usually the 24H high.

I scouted for perfect situations: like low RSI on the weekly chart and high, exhausted RSI in hourly and lower timeframes. I usually waited for a red rejection wick with medium to high sell volume and EMA crossing the SMA favorably. This was my entry. I waited on the short for a few moments to make sure I wasn’t the exit liquidity. I then waited for the fair value gap to close, at least halfway or quarterly, before exiting. Even a 2% move in the market with 10x leverage was enough to get me a good return. If all the above stars aligned just right, I would see a golden fall, almost doubling my portfolio. Once, my investment of 1k gave a return of 220% in less than a minute.

But honestly, this wasn’t always the case. Revenge and emotional trading killed a lot of money. I saw both huge losses and decent profits on a daily basis. In my one-week spree, I earned well, more than I expected too. Still, I wouldn’t recommend doing this daily. I clocked in more hours on this than I slept that week. I was liquidated multiple times, costing me enough to rethink my life. So, in order to kill the cycle, I stopped.

### _Well, on the other hand..._

It’s kind of been exhausting jumping around Indie Hackers and other boards for random ideas to tinker with. An idle virtual machine is a devil’s prod environment. All of them use AI and vibe coding. In the past couple of weeks, the philosophy of vibe coding has grown tenfold compared to last winter. It made me sit with my laptop and try out code generators like Bolt and Tempo, and honestly, it’s complete magic for real.

Development of a web app complete with user sign-in, a monthly subscription system, and dashboards in less than five minutes is pure magic. This is probably the next new coding philosophy, after ChatGPT helping to write certain parts of the code or explain docs. Though the previous method required knowledge of what you were trying to build, now it’s optional. SaaS startups are flowing in at the same rate as banks printing new money.

At the same time, ironically, I see multiple full-stack developers, years younger than me, with portfolio websites. With everything. Not even kidding. React, TypeScript, Vite, Next, Express, you name it. And I thought this industry was dead. They’ve already worked in some sort of professional setting, probably a non-profit project or a self-started something, which is impressive for their age.

This made me feel the need to learn JavaScript and start making UI elements. Not only would it help me build better UIs for projects that really need one, like adding Electron, but better yet, I’d actually know what the fuck is going on when I see JavaScript async/await shit, hah.

All I thought was that it would add a skill badge in a different trade. I already know Tailwind CSS, and I’ve worked with server setups over the cloud, Nginx, and Tor and shit. Easier said than done. For a fact, I know JavaScript, just the fun part. I haven’t even touched the DOM, and I’m a complete stranger to Node. So instead of battling with myself, I made peace with being JavaScript-illiterate. And if I’m ever gonna use JavaScript, I’ll probably use HTMX and Alpine.js, as I’d only be doing frontend at most.

For as a great man once said:

```
People who list JavaScript frameworks and assembly in the same resume are either dead or schizophrenic.
