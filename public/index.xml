      <description>This is a project i made more than a month ago as a first semester student and as a complete beginner. It not only introduced me to new concepts but also to a completely new and foreign field. Most students prefer to display projects like this or similar project certificates on their LinkedIn profiles, filling their profiles with useless certificates and other shits, making a complete mockery of whatever professionalism is left on their profile (seriously man, who the hell posts a &amp;ldquo;scamper project&amp;rdquo; they did on a product in a &amp;ldquo;professional skills development&amp;rdquo; class, a subject which has 0 credits in college).</description>

      <description>It’s been more than a year since I wrote something. Not my fault that my life was ridiculously monotonous for a long while, but still, a great deal of stuff happened during these months: I passed high school, got into college, and I’m now studying for a degree in Electronics and Comms Engineering.&#xA;From another standpoint, a lot has happened too: planned multiple projects, never ended up doing them, coded an &amp;ldquo;automatic reels generator&amp;rdquo; called Cassette, which generated informative reels with Python.</description>

      <description>Well&amp;hellip;As the Title suggests&amp;hellip;I have completed the static site generator which I was talking about in my previous post. Its up in my github account or follow this link to get there&amp;hellip;The motive behind this was pretty simple, I wanted a SSG which was customisable so that I can set it up with Tailwind css, not over-complicated but had all the things it was supposed to. For example, Hugo has some millions of parameters, shortcodes, partials and other things which baffled the heck out of me&amp;hellip;it took me nearly a week to understand how the hell to create a simple page with it, let alone setup tailwind css&amp;hellip;with postcss.</description>

      <description>Sooo&amp;hellip;its been long since an update, and I felt kinda guilty for not being able to write anything (im lazy). Well, I pulled off some massive shits, like Lofi-Cafe, the heritage of this site, which functions by playing live streaming music from lofi girl&amp;rsquo;s channel on youtube and lets you listen to lofi without using that CPU intensive youtube site&amp;hellip;.and also saves your data&amp;hellip;which is pretty impressive. This thing was commited to this site last year early November or so&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>Sooo&amp;hellip;.I have spend more than a hundred hours looking for a free vps, and I think I found it&amp;hellip;.a company by the name of mogenius.com allows users to create Ubuntu 18.04 VPS or Alpine Linux VPS (it also allows Nginx and other preconfigured templates and databses&amp;hellip;check out the docs for more info)&amp;hellip;guess what? I got one of those sweet Ubuntu bionic releases and it already feels good to know that I have spare PC in the cloud, to which I can ssh anytime I want&amp;hellip;They are like the &amp;ldquo;free alternative&amp;rdquo; to the high-end cloud services like digital ocean or linode.</description>

      <description>Hiyaa, its my first time blogging and I am pretty lost for words, and content&amp;hellip;.both&amp;hellip;So lets just talk abt the new Onion server which i hosted&amp;hellip;previously, it was hosted on Heroku and yesterday night it was migrated to Render, who are gracious enough to keep a free plan without a credit card, but there are some downsides too.&#xA;Hosting a Onion server on heroku or render or any PaaS service is like fighting with a double eged sword&amp;hellip;.</description>
